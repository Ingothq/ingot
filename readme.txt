A/B testing made easy for WordPress - Do less, convert more.

== Description ==
[Ingot](https://ingothq.com/) is the simplest way to make your WordPress site perform better for your business â€” sell more, get more sign ups, get more out of your online marketing. Easy to use, affordable, and requires no 3rd party services.

A/B testing is a proven technique to increase conversions on your site, but traditionally it has required a lot of traffic, a connection to a costly 3rd-party service and an expert to read the results. Busy WordPress site managers don't have time for that? Who does? Ingot changes all of that. Ingot takes a few minutes to setup, and then it just works, constantly evolving your site to find the results that convert best.

Don't worry that you made the wrong choice when you chose your call to action text, site headline, or pricing, let Ingot find the best performing option. Don't worry about missing out on sales because you didn't have time to test, use Ingot -- the easy, yet surprisingly affordable A/B Testing solution for WordPress.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.4 or greater
* PHP version 5.5 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Ingot, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Ingot" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
For more FAQs go to [https://ingothq.com/documentation/ingot-faq/](https://ingothq.com/documentation/ingot-faq/)

= How Hard Is It To Implement A Test? =
Not hard at all. Can you fill out a form? Can you insert a shortcode into a page? Then you can use Ingot.

= Is Ingot Free? =
Ingot is free to try for two weeks. Once your trial has expired, you can choose one of our plans.

= Will Ingot break my site if my trial or subscription expires? =
No, not at all, that would be terrible. If you do not have an active subscription, Ingot will output the first variation from a test group and will not register any stats. This way your site still has valid HTML and looks right. BTW, this is the same way we always treat bots, which need valid HTML -- since a bot may be Google -- but we don't want to track them.

= Does Ingot work with a caching system ? =
Yes. Many sites use a static HTML cache, which could be an issue if we didn't work around them. Ingot works around this by using a small JavaScript file to check that any tests on the page are unused, and if needed updating the HTML on the page via AJAX. This doesn't cause a full page refresh or anything, Ingot only updates the part of the page that needs updated.
